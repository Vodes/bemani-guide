## Why would you want to use a server?

!!! info "While CHUNITHM can be run offline, connecting to a server gives you the ability to create a profile, save scores, and unlock additional features."

## Self hosted local servers

!!! tip ""
    If you wish to run the game locally, but with the ability to create and save a profile, you can run a server on the same computer you are playing the game on. This server will need to be running before you launch the game, however it can be shut down when you are no longer playing.  

    These 2 projects are still in active development, and as such, any provided setup instructions are likely to become outdated rather quickly.  

    Please refer to the included setup instructions on each projects respective web page.

### ARTEMiS

!!! info "A network service emulator for games running SEGA'S ALL.NET service, and similar."
    [ARTEMiS](https://gitea.tendokyu.moe/Hay1tsme/artemis) is a network service emulator for various ALL.NET games. It runs on Python.  

    While initial setup is more involved than AquaDX, it offers a more complete emulation of the ALL.NET service.  

    ARTEMiS also uses your own game files to build its database, meaning any new content updates can just be imported to the server yourself, without having to wait for someone else to provide an update.

### AquaDX

!!! info "Multipurpose game server powered by Spring Boot, for ALL.Net-based games"
    [AquaDX](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/AquaDX) is a game server targetting SEGA Rhythm Games specifically and runs on Java.  

    Initial setup for AquaDX is a little easier as more of the setup is provided by the developers.  

    AquaDX does not currently support importing your own game data. You will need to head back to the github page to download and updated build if new content becomes available.

## Online Hosted Servers

!!! tip "There are a few online hosted servers that support Chunithm SUN PLUS, however they are all currently invite only. Ask your friends where they play, and maybe they'll invite you!"
